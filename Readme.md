### PHP  read-eval-print loop
REPL stands for read-eval-print loop. It's a language shell that reads user input, evaluates the input using a programming language (in this case, PHP), and prints the output to the screen. Then, it returns to the read state (that's the loop part).
```
composer repl
```
